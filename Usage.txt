First give the number of device needed in LAN. All the machine will get their
IP and MAC address. After that you can start giving command to the console.

1.  change-ip <ip-address>                  # To get to the console of
                                            # desired device
    change-ip lan                           # To get back to LAN

2.  show                                    # To view device stat
                                            # (not for using in LAN)
    show all                                # To view all the devices'
                                            # stat (only for LAN)
    show <ip-address>                       # To view a specific device's
                                            # stat (only for LAN)

3.  send arp <ip-address>                   # To broadcast an ARP request
    send normal <ip-address> <payload>      # To send a normal packet

4.  receive                                 # To receive the top packet
                                            # from the queue
5.  spoof <fake-src-ip> <dest-ip>           # To spoof the identity
